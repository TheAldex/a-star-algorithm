# A* IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLE (Artificial Intelligence)

Implementation in of the A* algorithm for minimum path search to the Athens metro. 

This small app developed using Python allows the user through an interface to choose a station of origin and a destination station and then paint on the subway map the minimum path between them, as well as the time it will take and the distance traveled.

The map used is the one shown below and it shows all the station names and the lines on which they are located:

python3 main.py

Then you will see the interface and you could enjoy trying it!
